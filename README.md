RECIPE WEBSITE PROJECT
Miles Eastwood -- January 2022

This is a practice website I am creating as a part of the Project Odin curriculum.
I will use it to practice the html/css/javascript I am learning as part of the course.

The website will be a basic recipe website, with a home page and links to recipes on other pages.
